## Day 2 - Clarity Smart Contract - Hello World

Took a stab at Muneeb's tutorial of creating and testing a Clarity contract: 
https://github.com/clarity-lang/overview/blob/master/tutorial-hello-world.md

Thanks to Muneeb for this tutorial! 

In this tutorial, I learned lhow to test Clarity and how use Mocha to test Clarity contracts while you develop them.

Now, I have (1) a working Clarity starter project and (2) I understand how to test Clarity code using .ts files and Mocha.

Proof of Work

## Day 3 - December 12, 2021 - Clarinet, Node.JS, and Javascripting

Feels like I'm all over the place today, but started learning about Clarinet via Hiro Dev's website: https://docs.hiro.so/smart-contracts/clarinet#installing-clarinet

I also took a shot at learning the basics about Node.JS through this YouTube video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENrzD9HAZK4&ab_channel=Fireship 

At last, I did some coding with https://nodeschool.io/#workshoppers and worked on the core "Javascripting" since I'm learning how to code in Javascript still. I completed the first challenge within Javascripting. Hoping to pick it back up tomorrow.

A little everyday helps!
