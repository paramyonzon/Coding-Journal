## Day 2 - Clarity Smart Contract - Hello World

Took a stab at Muneeb's tutorial of creating and testing a Clarity contract: 
https://github.com/clarity-lang/overview/blob/master/tutorial-hello-world.md

Thanks to Muneeb for this tutorial! 

In this tutorial, I learned lhow to test Clarity and how use Mocha to test Clarity contracts while you develop them.

Now, I have (1) a working Clarity starter project and (2) I understand how to test Clarity code using .ts files and Mocha.
